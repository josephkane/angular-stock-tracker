# AngularStockTracker - Joe Kane

## Angular/CLI

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed by running `ng --version`. If not installed, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Run app

After cloning the repo, `cd` in to the project folder and run `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. A new browser window will automatically open and point to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
